RocketBook README

	Rocketbook is a simple program to run.  To begin with the GUI, run the GUI project.  When beginning, you can create an account or log into an existing account.  Doing so is straightforward as the GUI guides you through the steps.  Next, you can add friends while the GUI autocompletes searches for existing friends.  Once you have friends you can then see their public posts in your feed, and the rest is straightforward as you can message them, write posts yourself, create groups, etc.
	Running the TextUI is also straightforward and similar to running the GUI.  A user can create an account or log into an existing account, then add friends, post blogs and tweets, message, etc.
